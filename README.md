## English Language Learning assisted by Automated Speech Recognition

### January 2023
These are very early days for this project. The project aims to develop AI based English language learning software as a digital public good. This repository will hold the components of the core Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) engine.

### Principles

- **Pedagogy Centric** : Language learning pedagogy will drive the use cases, not the technology
- **Teacher First**    : Support the teacher, minimize student<->device engagement
- **Offline First**    : All run-time features must be available offline. Online is optional
- **Openness**         : Data, training algorithms and methods will also be open-source, not just an AI model end-product
