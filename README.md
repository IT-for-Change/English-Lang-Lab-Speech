## English Language Learning assisted by Automated Speech Recognition

### January 2023
These are very early days for this project. The project aims to develop AI based English language learning software as a digital public good. This repository will hold the components of the core Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) engine.

### Principles

- **Pedagogy Centric** : Language learning pedagogy will drive the use cases, not the technology
- **Teacher First**    : Support the teacher, minimize student<->device engagement
- **Offline First**    : All run-time features must be available offline. Online is optional
- **Openness**         : Data, training algorithms and methods will also be open-source, not just an AI model end-product
- **Extensibility**    : Allow additional data to be easily included. For example, add voice samples with heavy regional accents
- **Privacy by design**: Avoid collecting sensitive personal data unless the functionality requires it. Incorporate robust privacy practices in design.

## Broad Use cases:

### Spoken language assessment
Teachers are invariably constrained by student:teacher ratios, prescribed syllabi that they have to complete and time availability. Individual attention to a child suffers in the process. ASR can help assess a child's reading ability and provide feedback to the teacher so they can provide targeted assistance to students.

### Vocabulary and spellings
A teacher can do only so many vocabulary and spelling-dictation exercises within the classroom construct. And each of those exercises have to be manually graded by the teacher. An ASR driven front-end can help evaluate a child's vocabulary and spelling proficiency.
