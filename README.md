## English Language Learning assisted by Automated Speech Recognition

### January 2023
These are very early days for this project. The project aims to develop AI based English language learning software as a digital public good. This repository will hold the components of the core Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) engine. Other repositories will be spawned to hold frontend/api components.

### Principles

- **Pedagogy Centric** : Language learning pedagogy and teacher needs will drive software features, not the technology
- **Teacher First**    : Support the teacher, minimize student <-> computer interactions
- **Offline First**    : All run-time features must be available offline. Online may be optionally included
- **Openness**         : Data, training algorithms and methods will also be open-source, not just an AI model end-product
- **Extensibility**    : Allow additional voice samples to be easily included in the model pipeline. For example, augment with region-specific accents
- **Privacy by design**: Avoid collecting sensitive personal data unless the functionality requires it. Incorporate robust privacy practices in design

## Broad Use cases:

### Spoken language assessment
Teachers are invariably constrained by student:teacher ratios, the prescribed syllabus, and time availability. Individual attention to a student suffers as a result. An ASR based solution can help assess a child's language reading/speaking ability and provide feedback to the teacher so they can understand student abilities better and provide targeted assistance to them.

### Vocabulary and spellings
A teacher can do only so many vocabulary exercises and spelling-dictation activities within the classroom construct. And each of those exercises then have to be manually graded. An ASR driven front-end can help evaluate a child's vocabulary and spelling proficiency.

And more...
