# English-Lang-Lab-Speech

## English Language Learning assisted by Automated Speech Recognition

This is a project by the Centre for Education and Technology, IT for Change. Read more about us [here](https://itforchange.net/education).

### January 2023
These are very early days for this project. The project aims to develop AI based English language learning software as a digital public good. This repository will hold the components of the core Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) engine. Other repositories will be spawned to hold frontend/api components.

### Principles

- **Pedagogy Driven**  : Language learning pedagogy will drive software features, not the technology
- **Teacher First**    : Technology must support the teacher. Minimize student <-> computer interactions
- **Offline First**    : Run-time features must be available offline. Online may be optionally included
- **Openness**         : Data, training algorithms and methods will be open-source, not just an AI model end-product
- **Extensibility**    : Allow voice samples to be easily augmented in the pipeline. For example, add regional accents
- **Privacy by design**: Avoid collecting sensitive personal data. Incorporate robust privacy practices in design

## Broad Use cases:

### Spoken language assessment
Teachers are invariably constrained by student:teacher ratios, the prescribed syllabus, and time availability. Individual attention to a student suffers as a result, and especially so in repetitive language learning tasks. ASR based solutions can support a teacher's efforts in the classroom by assessing students' language reading/speaking abilities without significant time investment from the teacher, and enable the teacher to direct their valuable time towards targeted assistance to students.

### Vocabulary and spellings
A teacher can do only so many vocabulary exercises and spelling-dictation activities within the classroom construct. And each of those exercises then have to be manually graded. An ASR driven front-end can help the teacher i) evaluate students' vocabulary and spelling proficiencies and ii) provide focused guidance to students.

We take inspiration from FOSS language learning applications, and to spark new ideas in digital language learning. We continue to explore open source projects that will help us achieve our goals.
